## generate\_document.py

### **Description**

A script that will create a new document based on given reference documents.
The document created will be using AI guided by prompts found in a config file.

### **Inputs**

**Required:**
- Document type (a string that matches a config in a `documents.toml` file)
- Output filename (in markdown)
- List of files and/or directories containing reference documents. Reference
  files can be anything that can be opened as plain text.

**Optional:**
- `--extensions`: Customize what file extensions to process. By default, only
txt and markdown files will be processed. This can be a list of values that we
will use to filter the files types to process.
- `--level-limit`: Limits the directory level to traverse when looking for
text files. Defaults to 0, for no limit. Any integer >= 1 will traverse
accordingly.
- `--config`: Path to a toml config file. Defaults to looking for a 
  `documents.toml` file where the script is run, then inside script's app
  module. Raises an error when no config is found with valid content.

**`documents.toml`**

This config contains document types to generate. The following will be provided
as defaults:

- keywords: Picks out topics or subjects from the provided files with
  A brief description for each based on how it was used or defined. Groups
  keywords found by file.
- reading\_assignment: Creates a reading article for studying from the provided
  files. Each file will be a main heading. Provide summary, key ideas, 
  questions, stories. Prefer paraphrasing directly from the files.
- book: Creates a book from the provided files. Each file becomes a chapter.
  Keeping faithful to the text is important. Reorganize into coherent
  sentences > paragraphs > topics. Decide whether to use an instructional or
  story telling voice depending on context, and keep it consistent.

Each config should have the following sections:
- model: To customize what gpt model to use.
- description: Describes what the config is for.
- prompt: Used as guidance for generating the document.


## text\_combiner.py

### **Description**

A script that will combine text files into one.

- Required: Output filename
- Required: Accepts a list of files and/or list of directories containing text files.
- Optional:
  - `--extensions`: Customize what file extensions to process. By default, only
    txt files will be processed. This can be a list of values that we will use
    to filter the files types to process.
  - `--level-limit`: Limits the directory level to traverse when looking for
    text files. Defaults to 0, for no limit. Any integer >= 1 will traverse
    accordingly.
  - `--combine-by`: Sets how the files will be combined.
    - `EOF`: End of file. Combines files as they are.
    - `NEW`: New line. The contents of the next file are appended on the next
      line. This is the default.
  - `--order-by`: Orders the files found or given. Defaults to None to support
    the order of how the files were given in the parameter and for files in
    directories that were explicitly ordered. Otherwise provide option for:
    - `[-]created`: Created time asc or desc
    - `[-]modified`: Modified time asc or desc
    - `[-]name`: Name asc or desc
  - `--section-title`: Inserts a text that serves to seperate the contents of
    one file from the next. This will ignore the `--combine-by` option as this
    will always insert a new line before and after the section title:
    ```
    ...end of file 1 contents.

    File 2 Section Title

    File 2 contents...
    ```
    - `filename`: Uses the filename as the section title. This is default.
    - `smart-filename`: Uses AI to generate a section title based on the
      filename.
    - `smart-content`: Uses AI to generate a section title based on the content
  - `--section-title-format`: Sets the format of the section title. If not set,
    we will just use whatever is generated by the section title.
    - `title`: Use title case.
    - `lower`: Use lower case.
    - `upper`: Use upper case.
  - `--section-title-heading`: Customize the heading modifier of the section
    title. For now this is markdown headings only. Default is none.
