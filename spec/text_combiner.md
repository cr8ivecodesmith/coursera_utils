Text Combiner Spec
===

## **Sources**

Main module:
- `app/text_combiner.py`


## **Description**

A script that will combine text files into one.

- Required: Output filename
- Required: Accepts a list of files and/or list of directories containing text files.
- Optional:
  - `--extensions`: Customize what file extensions to process. By default, only
    txt files will be processed. This can be a list of values that we will use
    to filter the files types to process.
  - `--level-limit`: Limits the directory level to traverse when looking for
    text files. Defaults to 0, for no limit. Any integer >= 1 will traverse
    accordingly.
  - `--combine-by`: Sets how the files will be combined.
    - `EOF`: End of file. Combines files as they are.
    - `NEW`: New line. The contents of the next file are appended on the next
      line. This is the default.
  - `--order-by`: Orders the files found or given. Defaults to None to support
    the order of how the files were given in the parameter and for files in
    directories that were explicitly ordered. Otherwise provide option for:
    - `[-]created`: Created time asc or desc
    - `[-]modified`: Modified time asc or desc
    - `[-]name`: Name asc or desc
  - `--section-title`: Inserts a text that serves to seperate the contents of
    one file from the next. This will ignore the `--combine-by` option as this
    will always insert a new line before and after the section title:
    ```
    ...end of file 1 contents.

    File 2 Section Title

    File 2 contents...
    ```
    - `filename`: Uses the filename as the section title. This is default.
    - `smart-filename`: Uses AI to generate a section title based on the
      filename.
    - `smart-content`: Uses AI to generate a section title based on the content
  - `--section-title-format`: Sets the format of the section title. If not set,
    we will just use whatever is generated by the section title.
    - `title`: Use title case.
    - `lower`: Use lower case.
    - `upper`: Use upper case.
  - `--section-title-heading`: Customize the heading modifier of the section
    title. For now this is markdown headings only. Default is none.
