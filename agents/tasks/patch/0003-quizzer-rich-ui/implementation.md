# Quizzer Rich UI Migration — Implementation

## Understanding
- Replace the Textual-driven quiz interface with a Rich-based synchronous session loop so `study quizzer start` stays interactive in a standard terminal while preserving current quiz, navigation, and summary behaviours.
- Assumptions / Open questions:
  - Keep `aggregate_summary` and `summarize_results` helpers (may relocate to a Rich-focused module) to avoid regressions in reporting logic.
  - No backward compatibility shims for the Textual API are required; callers should migrate to the Rich session entry point.
  - Rich session will run synchronously using `Console`/`Live` without needing asyncio; confirm no existing code depends on Textual-specific features beyond current helpers.
  - Expose a public `run_quiz_session(questions, console, input_provider, *, show_explanations=True)` entry point in `study_utils/quizzer/session.py` so both CLI and tests share the same seam.
  - Ship a `QuizSessionResult` dataclass conveying the ordered response records, aggregate summary, and how the loop terminated so consumers can assert behaviour without scraping Rich output.
  - CLI wiring will continue to surface `--shuffle`, `--num`, and `--explain`; the session entry point will accept these inputs explicitly, while `--mix` and `--resume` remain no-ops surfaced by existing placeholder messaging.
- Risks & mitigations:
  - Risk of regressions in navigation/command parsing: mitigate with fine-grained unit tests covering command handling, invalid inputs, and end-of-quiz submission.
  - Potential Rich rendering differences across terminals: favor simple text tables/panels; provide deterministic console output for tests via `Console(record=True)`.
  - After removing the Textual layer, confirm downstream imports fail fast (clear errors) rather than silently breaking behaviour.
  - Ensuring coverage/ruff compliance after large refactor: bake checklist items into plan and run tools before completion.

## Impact Analysis
### Affected behaviors & tests
- Quiz session navigation (`next`, `prev`, `quit`, `submit`) → update/replace `tests/test_quiz_session_ui.py` to cover new Rich session APIs.
- Question rendering and summaries → supersede `tests/test_quizzer_view_extra.py` with Rich-friendly cases, including edge cases (empty bank, invalid command, repeated answers).
- CLI `study quizzer start` flow → add dedicated tests (or expand existing CLI tests if present) to ensure CLI wires shuffle/limit/explanation options into `run_quiz_session` and that placeholder warnings persist for not-yet-implemented mix/resume behaviour.
### Affected source files
- Create: `src/study_utils/quizzer/session.py` (Rich interaction layer) and supporting helper modules if needed (no replacement `view` package).
- Modify: `src/study_utils/quizzer/_main.py`, `src/study_utils/quizzer/__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml`, any README/CLI docs referencing Textual.
- Delete: `src/study_utils/quizzer/view/__init__.py`, `src/study_utils/quizzer/view/quiz.py`, `src/study_utils/quizzer/view/quiz.tcss`, obsolete Textual-specific test stubs.
- Config/flags: Remove `textual` from `pyproject.toml` dependencies/dev groups; ensure Rich listed if not already.
### Security considerations
- Maintain local-only handling of quiz content; ensure no sensitive data logged. Validate user command parsing avoids shell execution or unsafe eval.

## Solution Plan
- Architecture/pattern choices: adopt seam-first approach (per `patterns-and-architecture.md`) by isolating Rich console interactions behind a `QuizSession` controller plus a pure `QuizSessionState` (questions, index, selections) so logic stays testable; inject `Console` and input providers via `run_quiz_session` to keep rendering and command parsing separate.
- DI & boundaries: follow `engineering-guide.md` guidance by separating pure data helpers (`summarize_results`, `aggregate_summary`) from I/O-bound session controller; expose factories for CLI entry to inject shuffling/limits and fall back to defaults.
- Stepwise checklist:
  - [x] Introduce `quizzer/session.py` with `QuizSessionState` (pure data/state), `QuizSessionResult` (return payload), and a `QuizSession` controller that cooperates with Rich rendering helpers exposed via `run_quiz_session`.
  - [x] Move or wrap summary helpers in the new module while preserving import surface for downstream callers and ensure they populate the `QuizSessionResult` aggregate fields.
  - [x] Update CLI (`_main.py`) to call the new session runner and adjust exports in `__init__.py`.
  - [x] Remove Textual files, dependency, and any compatibility wrappers from the codebase (`view/__init__.py`, `view/quiz.py`, `view/quiz.tcss`, `pyproject.toml`).
  - [x] Rewrite/replace unit tests to cover Rich session flow, command handling, and summaries with deterministic console captures.
  - [x] Prune Textual-specific tests or helper utilities rather than leaving stubs.
  - [x] Update docs/help text referencing Textual to describe the Rich-based CLI.
  - [x] Run `ruff check` and address any findings.
  - [x] Run `pytest --cov` ensuring 100% coverage for touched areas.
  - [x] Perform manual smoke test of `study quizzer start` capturing instructions in History.

## Test Plan
- Unit: cover command parsing (valid/invalid inputs, navigation, submit/quit), summary table generation, empty question bank handling, CLI wiring with monkeypatched Console/input (including propagation of shuffle/limit/explain flags), assert that removing Textual exports surfaces clear `AttributeError` for deprecated symbols, and verify the returned `QuizSessionResult` mirrors the printed summary data.
- Contract: none required (no external service boundary changes).
- Integration/E2E: add CLI-level test using `click.testing.CliRunner`-style harness or existing CLI test utilities if available; manual smoke test of actual CLI session post-implementation.
- Manual checks (if needed): run `study quizzer start <name>` against sample bank verifying navigation, submission summaries align with spec.

## Operability
- Telemetry: ensure concise Rich console messages for start/end/error states; no additional logging needed.
- Dashboard/alert updates: not applicable.
- Runbooks / revert steps: document in History how to revert by restoring Textual files/dependency if needed.
